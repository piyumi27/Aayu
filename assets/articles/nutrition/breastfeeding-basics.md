Breastfeeding is one of the most natural and beneficial things you can do for your baby. However, it's also completely normal if it doesn't feel natural at first! This guide will help you get started with confidence.

## Why Breastfeed?

### Benefits for Baby
- **Perfect nutrition**: Breast milk adapts to your baby's changing needs
- **Strong immunity**: Antibodies protect against infections
- **Better digestion**: Easier on baby's developing digestive system
- **Bonding**: Skin-to-skin contact strengthens your connection

### Benefits for Mother
- **Faster recovery**: Helps uterus return to pre-pregnancy size
- **Natural contraception**: (Though not 100% reliable)
- **Health benefits**: Reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancer
- **Convenience**: Always available at the right temperature

## Getting Started: The First 24 Hours

### Immediate After Birth
1. **Skin-to-skin contact** immediately after delivery
2. **First feed** within the first hour if possible
3. **Colostrum** - your baby's first superfood

> **Did you know?** Colostrum is often called "liquid gold" because it's packed with antibodies and nutrients in a small, concentrated amount perfect for your newborn's tiny stomach.

## Proper Positioning and Latching

### Common Positions

#### 1. Cradle Hold
- Most common position
- Baby's head in crook of your arm
- Baby's body facing yours

#### 2. Cross-Cradle Hold
- Good for newborns
- Support baby's head with opposite hand
- More control over baby's position

#### 3. Side-Lying Position
- Great for nighttime feeding
- Both you and baby lie on your side
- Comfortable for C-section recovery

### Signs of Good Latch
✅ Baby's mouth covers most of the areola  
✅ Baby's lips are flanged outward  
✅ You hear swallowing sounds  
✅ Feeding feels comfortable (after initial seconds)  

### Signs of Poor Latch
❌ Nipple pain that continues throughout feeding  
❌ Clicking or smacking sounds  
❌ Baby seems frustrated  
❌ Nipple appears compressed after feeding
