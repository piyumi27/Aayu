All notable changes to the Aayu project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-08-20] - UI Enhancements and Performance Optimization

### Updated
- **Authentication Screen Design**
  - Removed duplicate headers from Login and Register screens (previously showing same title in AppBar and body)
  - Completely removed unnecessary AppBars from both authentication screens for cleaner, full-screen experience
  - Login screen: Added person outline icon with blue gradient circle background (#0086FF)
  - Register screen: Added person add icon with green gradient circle background (#32CD32)
  - Register screen: Added floating back button with shadow for navigation without AppBar
  - Improved visual hierarchy and reduced redundancy in authentication flow
  - Full-screen design provides more space for content and better mobile experience

- **Lottie Animation Performance**
  - Implemented precise per-animation loading tracking to show accurate loading states
  - Added dedicated AnimationControllers for each slide with proper lifecycle management
  - Individual loading indicators per slide - only show loading for animations that haven't loaded yet
  - Loading indicator automatically disappears when specific animation completes loading
  - Controlled animation playback - only animate current visible slide for better performance
  - Used user-requested Lottie URLs:
    - Slide 1: Rocket Launch animation (https://assets9.lottiefiles.com/packages/lf20_5tl1xxnz.json)
    - Slide 2: Medical/vaccine animation (https://assets3.lottiefiles.com/packages/lf20_tutvdkg0.json)
